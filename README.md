Task 1: Logic Explanation for Extracting Join Conditions from the WHERE Clause

Logic Explanation:
The logic for join condition extraction is incorporated within the WhereClauseProcessor component, as part of the executeSQL method. This component discerns conditions within the WHERE clause that are applicable for immediate selection (single-table conditions) versus those that define relationships between tables (join conditions).


The execution follows a sequential approach:

1. Initial Selections: Applying selection conditions directly via the SELECT operator ensures that the data volume is prudently reduced prior to performing join operations.

2. Deferred Join Conditions: The system then attempts to apply join conditions. If the current schema does not satisfy a join condition due to missing columns, the condition is deferred. The system will complete the joins across all tables before enforcing the join condition, thus ensuring that it is only applied when all requisite columns are present.


Code Structure:
Condition Processing:
-The WhereClauseProcessor is initialized in the executeSQL method.
-The WHERE clause is analyzed by plainSelect.getWhere().accept(clauseProcessor) to identify selection and join conditions.

Join Logic:
-The extraction and application of join conditions occur within the loop that iterates over tableInfos.
-Join conditions are specifically processed in the section boolean canApplyJoinCondition = canApplyJoinCondition(joinCondition, combinedSchema);. Here, the system determines if the conditions are applicable to the combinedSchema before creating a new JoinOperator.

For detailed insight into the logic and methodology of the extraction process, refer to the in-code comments within the WhereClauseProcessor component.



Task 2: Optimization Strategies


1. Early Selection Application 

Apply Selections Early: The cornerstone of our optimization strategy is the early application of selections. By applying WHERE clause conditions directly to scan operations as early as possible, I reduce the volume of data processed in later stages. This "selection pushdown" strategy ensures that only relevant data passes through the execution pipeline, enhancing overall query performance.


2. Join Strategies: Left Deep Join Trees and Join Ordering

Left Deep Join Trees: This approach ensures that the leftmost (or base) table is fixed, and each subsequent table is joined to this existing structure. This approach supports efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Strategic Join Ordering: By rearranging joins post-selection, we minimize intermediate result sizes, thus optimizing computational resource allocation.


3. Aggregation Optimization(GroupBy and SUM)

Aggregations involving GROUP BY clauses are strategically performed once selections and joins have reduced the data volume. The aggregation approach uses a mapping technique where group-by column values are concatenated to form unique keys, which serve as identifiers for aggregation groups. This method ensures efficient computation of aggregates and maintains performance for queries with complex grouping.


4. OrderBy Optimization: 

Sorting is the final step in our query execution plan. With the data already filtered, joined, aggregated, and projected, the ORDER BY operation works on the smallest possible data set, enhancing sorting efficiency.
